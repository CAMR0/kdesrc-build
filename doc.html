<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>kdesvn-build is a Perl script to help users install <a
href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> from <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</A>.  You may also want to
consider the kde-build script include with KDE's kdesdk module.</p>

<p id="emailaddy">It is authored by Michael Pyne (mpyne (AT) grammarian (DOT) homelinux 
(DOT) net).</p>

<hr>
<a name="features"></a>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Features that I can think of off the top of my head:
<ul>

<li>Automatically checks out or updates modules from Subversion, as
appropriate.</li>

<li><strike>Support for checking out specific branches of Subversion
modules.</strike> This work still needs to be completed.</li>

<li>Times the build process for modules.</li>

<li>Will automatically try to rebuild modules that were using incremental
make, which is prone to failure after certain kinds of commits.</li>

<li>Can resume a previous script, or start the build process from a particular
module.</li>

<li>Comes built-in with a sane set of default options appropriate for building
a base KDE single-user installation from the anonymous Subversion repository.
</li>

<li><A href="http://www.kde.me.uk/index.php?page=unsermake">Unsermake</A>
support.</li>

<li>Tilde-expansion for your configuration options.  For example, you can
specify: <pre>qtdir ~/kdesvn/build/qt-copy</pre></li>

<li>Configurable build, source, and logging directories</li>

<li>Automatically sets up a build system, with the source directory not the
same as the build directory, in order to keep the source directory
pristine. The exception is qt-copy, which isn't designed to be built like
that (unless you'd like to test <a
href="#conf-use-qt-builddir-hack">use-qt-builddir-hack</a>).</li>

<li>You can specify global options to apply to every module to check out, and
you can specify options to apply to individual modules as well.</li>

<li>Since the autotools sometimes get out of sync with changes to the
source tree, you can force a rebuild of a module by creating a file called
.refresh-me in the build directory of the module in question, or by running
kdesvn-build with the --refresh-build option.</li>

<li>You can specify various environment values to be used during the build,
including KDEDIR, QTDIR, DO_NOT_COMPILE, and CXXFLAGS.</li>

<li>Command logging.  Logs are dated and numbered so that you always have a
log of a script run.  Also, a special symlink called latest is created to
always point to the most recent log entry in the log directory.</li>

<li>If you're using a user build of KDE instead of a system build (for which
you must be root to install), you can use the script to install for you.  I
haven't audited this code, and it makes ample use of the <code>system()</code>
call, so I would not recommend running it as root at this point.</li>

<li>You can use <a href="#conf-make-install-prefix">make-install-prefix</a> to
prefix the make install command line with a separate command, which is useful
for sudo.</li>

<li>You can use the <a href="#conf-apidox">apidox</a> option to automatically
build and install the API documentation for some modules.</li>

<li>You can check out only a portion of a KDE Subversion module.  For example,
you could check out only taglib from kdesupport, or only K3B from
extragear/multimedia.  The script will automatically pull in kde-common if
necessary to make the build work.</li>

<li>You can "pretend" to do the operations.  If you pass --pretend or -p on the
command line, the script will give a very verbose description of the commands
it is about to execute, without actually executing it.</li>

</ul></p>
<p>Things that kdesvn-build does NOT do:
<ul>
<li>Find the fastest KDE Subversion mirror.  There isn't even a list shipped
with the script at this point, although the default server should work
fine.</li>
<li>Brush your teeth.  You should remember to do that yourself.</li>
<li>The script probably isn't bug-free.  Sorry.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<hr>
<a name=".kdesvn-buildrc"></a>
<h3>Format of .kdesvn-buildrc</h3>
<p>To use the script, you must have a file in your home directory called
.kdesvn-buildrc, which describes the modules you'd like to download and
build.</p>
<p>It starts with the global options, specified like the following:</p>
<code>global<br/>
<i>option-name option-value</i><br/>
<i>[...]</i><br/>
end global
</code>
<p>It is then followed by one or more module sections, specified like the
following:</p>
<code>module <i>module-name</i><br/>
<i>option-name option-value</i><br/>
<i>[...]</i><br/>
end module
</code>
<p><i>module-name</i> must be a module from the KDE Subversion repository (for
example, kdelibs or kdebase).  Some options override global options, some
add to global options, and some global options simply can't be overridden.

<h3>Configuration file Options</h3>

<p>Here is a table of the various options, and some comments on them.  Any
option which overrides the global option will override a command line setting
as well.</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr align="center" style="font-style: italic;">
<td valign="top">Option-name</td>
<td valign="top">Module -&gt; Global Behavior</td>
<td>Notes</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-apidox">
<td valign="top">apidox</td>
<td valign="top">Overrides global</td>
<td>Set this option to 'true' in order to have kdesvn-build automatically
build and install the API documentation for the module after the normal build/install
process.  This only works for modules where 'make apidox' does something,
including kdelibs, kdebase, and koffice, among others.
</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-apply-qt-patches">
<td valign="top">apply-qt-patches</td>
<td valign="top">Overrides global</td>
<td>This option is only useful for qt-copy.  If it is set to a non-zero value,
then the apply-patches script in qt-copy will be run prior to building, in
order to apply the non-official patches to the qt-copy.  Since these patches
are normally the reason for using qt-copy instead of a stock Qt, it shouldn't
do any harm to enable it.  The default is to enable the patches.</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-binpath">
<td valign="top">binpath</td>
<td valign="top">Can't be overridden</td>
<td><p>Set this option to set the environment variable PATH while building.
You can't override this setting in a module option.  The default value is
<tt>/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin</tt>.  This environment
variable should include the colon-separated paths of your development
toolchain.  The paths $KDEDIR/bin and $QTDIR/bin are automatically added.  You
may use the tilde (~) for any paths you add using this option.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-build-dir">
<td valign="top">build-dir</td>
<td valign="top">Overrides global</td>
<td>Use this option to change the directory to contain the built sources. There
are three different ways to use it:
<ul>

<li><p>Relative to the KDE Subversion source directory (see <a
href="#conf-source-dir">the sourced-dir option</a>).  This is the default, and
the way the script worked up to version v0.61.  This mode is selected if you
type a directory name that doesn't start with a tilde (~) or a slash (/).</p>
<p>The default value is <b>build</b>.</p></li>

<li>Absolute path.  If you specify a path that begins with a /, then that path
is used directly.  For example, <i>/tmp/kde-obj-dir/</i>.</li>

<li>Relative to your home directory.  If you specify a path that begins with a
~, then the path is used relative to your home directory, analogous to the
shell's tilde-expansion.  For example, <i>~/builddir</i> would set the build
directory to <i>/home/mpyne/builddir</i> on my system.</li>

</ul>

Perhaps surprisingly, this option can be changed per module.

</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-build-system-only">
<td valign="top">build-system-only</td>
<td valign="top">Overrides global</td>
<td>Set this option to only create the build system for this module.  What that
means is that the <code>make -f Makefile.cvs</code> command will be run, and
the configure script will be created (but not run), and make will not be run.
This option is exactly equivalent to the <a
href="#cmdline-build-system-only">--build-system-only</a> command line option.
This command is useful for checking what configure-flags each module supports
so you can change your ~/.kdesvn-buildrc.
</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-checkout-only">
<td valign="top">checkout-only</td>
<td valign="top">Overrides global</td>
<td>Set this option to checkout Subversion sources piece by piece.  The value
for this option should be a space separated list of directories to checkout.
If you don't include the admin directory, it will automatically be included (if
necessary).  When checking out piece by piece, the admin directory will be
pulled in from kde-common, which is where it exists on the Subversion server.
Although this option overrides the global option, be aware that setting this as
a global option makes no sense.
</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-configure-flags">
<td valign="top">configure-flags</td>
<td valign="top">Appends to global option<br/>(except for qt-copy)</td>
<td>Use this option to specify what flags to pass to ./configure when creating
the build system for the module.  When this is used as a global-option, it is
applied to all modules that this script builds.  qt-copy uses a much different
set of configure options than the rest of KDE, so this option
<em>overrides</em> the global settings when applied to qt-copy.</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-colorful-output">
<td valign="top">colorful-output</td>
<td valign="top">Can't be overridden</td>
<td>Set this option to false to disable the colorful output of kdesvn-build.
This option defaults to 'true'.  Note that kdesvn-build won't output the
color codes to anything but a terminal (such as xterm, Konsole, or the normal
Linux console).
</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-cxxflags">
<td valign="top">cxxflags</td>
<td valign="top">Appends to global option</td>
<td>Use this option to specify what flags to pass to ./configure as the
CXXFLAGS when creating the build system for the module.  This option is
specified here instead of with <a
href="#conf-configure-flags">configure-flags</a> because this option will also
set the environment variable CXXFLAGS during the build process.
</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-debug">
<td valign="top">debug</td>
<td valign="top">Can't be overridden</td>
<td>This option enables the script's debug mode.  At this point, all this
switch does is disable logging to files, instead dumping all output to
stdout.  You should use the <a href="#cmdline-debug">--debug</a> command line
option instead, this option only exists to implement it internally.
</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-disable-build-list">
<td valign="top">disable-build-list</td>
<td valign="top">Can't be overridden</td>
<td>Normally kdesvn-build will write out the list of modules that were
successfully built to a file under the source directory called
'successfully-built'.  If you set this option to 0, kdesvn-build will skip
writing out the file.
</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-do-not-compile">
<td valign="top">do-not-compile</td>
<td valign="top">Overrides global</td>
<td><p>Use this option to set the DO_NOT_COMPILE environment variable prior to
running the configure script.  According to the <A
href="http://developer.kde.org/documentation/other/developer-faq.html">KDE
Developer FAQ</A>, this should cause any toplevel directory you pass to not be
built.  The directories should be space-separated.</p>

<p>Note that the sources to the programs will still be downloaded.  You can use
the <a href="#conf-checkout-only" class="conf-option">checkout-only</a>
directive to choose directories that you want to check out.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-inst-apps">
<td valign="top">inst-apps</td>
<td valign="top">Overrides global</td>
<td><p>This is the opposite of the <a
href="#conf-do-not-compile">do-not-compile</a> option.  This option makes it
so that only the given toplevel directories are built.  The directories should
be space-separated.</p>

<p>Any changes don't take effect until the next time make -f Makefile.cvs is
run, either automatically by the script, or manually by the <a
href="#cmdline-refresh-build">--refresh-build</a> or <a
href="#cmdline-recreate-configure">--recreate-configure</a> options.
</p>

<p>Note that the sources to the programs will still be downloaded.  You can use
the <a href="#conf-checkout-only" class="conf-option">checkout-only</a>
directive to choose directories that you want to check out.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-install-after-build">
<td valign="top">install-after-build</td>
<td valign="top">Overrides global</td>
<td>This option is used to install the package after it successfully builds.
This option is enabled by default.  If you want to disable this, you need to
set this option to 0 in the configuration file.  You can also use the
<a href="#cmdline-no-install">--no-install</a> command line flag.
</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-kdedir">
<td valign="top">kdedir</td>
<td valign="top">Can't be overridden</td>
<td>This option sets the directory that KDE will be installed to after it is
built.  It defaults to <tt>~/kde</tt>.  If you change this to a directory
needing root access, you may want to read about the <a
href="#conf-make-install-prefix">make-install-prefix</a> option as well.</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-libpath">
<td valign="top">libpath</td>
<td valign="top">Can't be overridden</td>
<td>Set this option to set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH while
building.  You can't override this setting in a module option.  The default
value is blank, but the paths $KDEDIR/lib and $QTDIR/lib are automatically
added.  You may use the tilde (~) for any paths you add using this option.
</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-lockfile">
<td valign="top">lockfile</td>
<td valign="top">Can't be overridden</td>
<td>
<p>The path of a file to use for script locking, to prevent parallel execution.
If you don't specify this value, the default is ~/.kdesvn-lock</p>

<p>If the script is unable to create this file, it will abort.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-log-dir">
<td valign="top">log-dir</td>
<td valign="top">Overrides global</td>
<td>Use this option to change the directory used to hold the log files
generated by the script.  This setting can be set on a per-module basis as of
version 0.64.
</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-make-install-prefix">
<td valign="top">make-install-prefix</td>
<td valign="top">Overrides global</td>
<td>Set this variable to a space-separated list, which is interpreted as a
command and its options to precede the make install command used to install
modules.  This is useful for installing packages with sudo for example, but
please be careful while dealing with root privileges.</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-make-options">
<td valign="top">make-options</td>
<td valign="top">Overrides global</td>
<td>Set this variable in order to pass command line options to the make
command.  This is useful for programs such as <a
href="http://distcc.samba.org/">distcc</a>.  distcc allows you to share your
compilation work among more than one computer.  To use it, you must use the -j
option to make.  Now you can.  According to the docs, 2 *
number_of_network_cpus is recommended.  I have 1 CPU total, so it would be
-j2 in my case.</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-manual-build">
<td valign="top">manual-build</td>
<td valign="top">Overrides global</td>
<td>Set the option value to 'true' to keep the build process from attempting to
build this module.  It will still be kept up-to-date when updating from Subversion.
This option is exactly equivalent to the <a
href="#cmdline-no-build">--no-build</a> command line option.
</td>

<tr id="conf-manual-update">
<td valign="top">manual-update</td>
<td valign="top">Overrides global</td>

update (and by extension, build or install) this module.  If you set this
option for a module, then you have pretty much commented it out.
</td>

<tr id="conf-module-base-path">
<td valign="top">module-base-path</td>
<td valign="top">Overrides global</td>
<td><p>Set this option to override kdesvn-build's default directory path to the
module in question.  This can be used, for example, to pull specific branches
or tagged versions of libraries.  <a href="http://websvn.kde.org/">The KDE
Source Viewer</a> is invaluable in helping to pick the right path.</p>
<p>Note that kdesvn-build constructs the final path according to the
following template: $svn-server/home/kde/$module-base-path/$module-name.</p>
<p>The default value is either 'trunk' or 'trunk/KDE', depending on the
modulename.</p>
</td>

</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-no-rebuild-on-fail">
<td valign="top">no-rebuild-on-fail</td>
<td valign="top">Overrides global</td>
<td>Set this option value to 'true' to always prevent kdesvn-build from trying
to rebuild this module if it should fail an incremental build.  Normally
kdesvn-build will try to rebuild the module from scratch to counteract the
effect of a stray Subversion update messing up the build system.</td>

</tr>

<tr id="conf-pretend">
<td valign="top">pretend</td>
<td valign="top">Can't be overridden</td>

equivalent to the <a href="#cmdline-pretend">--pretend</a> command line option.
</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-qtdir">
<td valign="top">qtdir</td>
<td valign="top">Can't be overridden</td>
<td>Set this option to set the environment variable QTDIR while building.
You can't override this setting in a module option.  If you don't specify
this option, it defaults to $(source-dir)/build/qt-copy, which uses the
qt-copy module included in the KDE source repository.
You may use a tilde (~) to represent your home directory.
</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-recreate-configure">
<td valign="top">recreate-configure</td>
<td valign="top">Overrides global</td>
<td>Use this option to re-run make -f Makefile.cvs and then reconfigure the

<td><p>This option accepts a space-separated set of values, where the first value
is the environment variable to set, and the rest of the values is what you
want the variable set to.  For example, to set the variable RONALD to
McDonald, you would put in the appropriate section this command:</p>
<pre>set-env RONALD McDonald</pre>
<p>This option is special in that it can be repeated without overriding
earlier set-env settings in the same section of the configuration file.  This
way you can set more than one environment variable per module (or
globally).</p>

<td valign="top">Overrides global</td>
<td>Although this option overrides the global option, it only makes sense for
qt-copy.  Set this option to 'true' to enable the script's <em>experimental</em>
srcdir != builddir mode.  When enabled, kdesvn-build will copy the qt-copy source
module to the build directory, and perform builds from there.  That means your
QTDIR environment variable should be set to $(qt-copy-build-dir)/qt-copy/lib
instead.  You should also change your <a href="#conf-qtdir">qtdir</a> option
accordingly.<br/><br/>
Incremental make should still work in this mode, as the timestamps will be
preserved after the copy.  If you use the <a

<li id="cmdline-no-svn">--no-svn, Skip contacting the Subversion server.</li>

<li id="cmdline-no-build">--no-build, Skip the build process.</li>

<li id="cmdline-no-install">--no-install, Don't automatically install packages
after they're built.</li>

<li id="cmdline-debug">--debug, Enables debug mode for the script.  Currently
this means that all output will be dumped to STDOUT in addition to being
logged in the log directory like normal.  Also, many functions are much more
verbose about what they're doing in debugging mode.</li>

<li id="cmdline-no-rebuild-on-fail">--no-rebuild-on-fail, Don't try and
rebuild modules that have failed building from scratch.  kdesvn-build will
never try to do this to a module that already was tried to be built from
scratch.

<li id="cmdline-refresh-build">--refresh-build, Recreate the build system and
make from scratch.</li>

<li id="cmdline-reconfigure">--reconfigure, Run the configure script again
without cleaning the build directory.</li>

<li id="cmdline-recreate-configure">--recreate-configure, Run <code>make -f
Makefile.cvs</code> again to create the configure script, and continue
building as normal.  This option implies --reconfigure.</li>

<li id="cmdline-resume">--resume, which tries to continue building from where
the script stopped last time.  The script starts building the module after the
last module to be compiled last time the script was run, whether or not it
succeeded.  This option implies <a href="#cmdline-no-svn">--no-svn</a>.  You
should not specify other module names on the command line.</li>

<li id="cmdline-resume-from">--resume-from, which is like <a
href="#cmdline-resume">--resume</a>, except that you supply the module to
start building from as the next parameter on the command line.  This option
implies <a href="#cmdline-no-svn">--no-svn</a>.  You should not specify
other module names on the command line.</li>

<li id="cmdline-rc-file">--rc-file, which interprets the next command line
parameter as the file to read the configuration options from.  The default
value for this parameter is ~/.kdesvn-buildrc.</li>

<li id="cmdline-prefix">--prefix=&lt;/path/to/kde&gt;, which allows you to
change the directory that KDE will be installed to from the command line.
This option implies <a href="#cmdline-reconfigure">--reconfigure</a>.</li>

<li id="cmdline-build-system-only">--build-system-only, Stop after runnning
make -f Makefile.cvs.  The configure script will still need to be run, which
kdesvn-build will do next time.  This lets you prepare all the configure
scripts at once so you can view the ./configure --help for each module, and
edit your configure-flags accordingly.</li>

<li id="cmdline-install">--install, If this is the only command-line option,
it tries to install all of the modules contained in successfully-built, except
for qt-copy, which doesn't need installation.  If command-line options are
specified after --install, they are all assumed to be modules to install.
</li>

Any other command-line options are assumed to be modules to update and build.
Don't mix building with installing.</li>
</ul>
