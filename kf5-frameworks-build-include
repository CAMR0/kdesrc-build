# Module definitions for building KDE Frameworks 5
# (cmake, KF5's dependencies, kdelibs frameworks, plasma-framework)

# Usage: Write your own kdesrc-buildrc with only a "global" section
# then include this file, like this:
#
# include extragear/utils/kdesrc-build/kf5-qt5-build-include
# (or using a full path)
#
# You can then add additional modules if desired.
#
# This file uses "branch groups" to decide which git branch to use. If you
# need to add your framework or library here please be sure to update
# kde-build-metadata repo's "logical-module-structure". It includes a simple
# tool you can use to validate your change works (or just "kdesrc-build -p
# your-module" and look for the right branch).

# ============================ Dependencies ==========================

module cmake-git
    repository git://cmake.org/cmake.git
end module

module libdbusmenu-qt
    # The lp: prefix refers to Canonical's Launchpad repository
    repository bzr://lp:libdbusmenu-qt
end module

# Attica will move to frameworks/ once the 4.x branch doesn't matter much anymore
module-set
    repository kde-projects
    use-modules kdesrc-build extra-cmake-modules attica
    # Optionally: add polkit-qt-1
    cmake-options -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=debug
end module-set

module-set phonon
    repository kde-projects
    cmake-options -DPHONON_BUILD_PHONON4QT5=ON
    # We avoid using just "phonon" as kdesrc-build will include all submodules
    # that have phonon as part of their path. (i.e. it means phonon/*), but we
    # don't want all the phonon backends.
    use-modules phonon/phonon phonon-vlc phonon-gstreamer
end module-set

# ============================= KDE Frameworks ========================

module-set frameworks
    repository kde-projects
    use-modules frameworks
    # KRunner depends on Plasma
    # KPrintUtils has been merged into kde4support
    ignore-modules krunner kprintutils
    # The CodeBlocks generator allows usage in QtCreator, while still generating Makefiles
    cmake-options -DBUILD_TESTING=TRUE -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=debug -G "CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles"
end module

module-set extra-frameworks
    repository kde-projects

    # TODO: finish moving plasma-framework to frameworks/
    use-modules plasma-framework krunner
end module-set

# Example of how to set options for just one module from a module-set... this is
# useful to have *after* your "include .../kf5-framework-build-include" in your
# kdesrc-buildrc if you just want to tweak some settings without adding/removing
# modules.
