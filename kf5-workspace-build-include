# Module definitions for building KDE Workspace 5

# Usage: Write your own kdesrc-buildrc with only a "global" section
# (including "branch-group kf5-qt5")
# then include this file, like this:
#
# include extragear/utils/kdesrc-build/kf5-frameworks-build-include
# include extragear/utils/kdesrc-build/kf5-applications-build-include
# (or using full paths)
#
# You can then add additional modules if desired.

module plasma-framework
    repository kde:plasma-framework
end module

# This module is temporary (parts of it depend on plasma, so it's here)
module kde-runtime
    repository kde:kde-runtime
    branch frameworks
end module

module kde-workspace
    repository kde:kde-workspace
    branch master
end module
