 * Argh, I should really stay away from the keyboard late at night, the whole
   repo-switching thing was really a repo-breaking thing.

Version history: 0.91
 * Use svn://anonsvn.kde.org/ instead of https://anonsvn.kde.org/ by default.
 * Automatically switch repositories if the user (or script) changes the value
   of svn-server.
 * Fix updating modules not using checkout-only, I'm not sure why this worked
   sometimes for me before.  This area of code could use some definite cleanup,
   I may spend a few hours tomorrow learning Perl objects to clean this crap
   up.

Version history: 0.90
 * Initial public release of kdesvn-build.
 * The release-tag option is broken for now.  Everything you build will be
   from /trunk (which was CVS HEAD).
 * Colorized output (controllable with the color option in the global config)
 * The SVN move also led to a slight reorganization of the repository.  People
   who were building things from kdeplayground or kdeextragear need to check
   their configuration file.  There are examples in the sample config file,
   also use websvn.kde.org to check the layout.
 * You should be able to run kdesvn-build with no configuration file and still
   get a sane basic setup.
 * Other stuff which I've forgotten.  Normally I use the diff command to make
   my changelogs but there's not much to diff against. ;)

Version history: 0.87
 * Added manual-update option.
 * Added $KDEDIR/lib/pkgconfig to pkg-config search path for digikam (and other
   programs that may use pkg-config with KDE in the future).
 * Don't warn when specifying modules on the command line along with the
   --install option.

Version history: 0.86
 * Add support for latest unsermake.
 * make options are no longer added when installing, it seems to confuse
   unsermake, and is only really useful for parallel builds anyways,
   which doesn't matter when installing.

Version history: 0.85
 * Fix bug where packages are built in reverse order. :-(
 * Show output when packages build successfully but fail on installation.
 * Don't show Packages Successfully Built if none were.
 * Fix bug where make-install-prefix no longer works.
 * Tweak kdecvs-pywizard

Version history: 0.84
 * Show failed updates in summary output.
 * You can now update or build only part of a module directly from the command line.
 * Log command outputs the command it's logging in debug mode.

Version history: 0.83
 * Added option, --ignore-modules.

Version history: 0.82
 * Add hack to make kdebindings build using builddir == srcdir even though
   srcdir is really != builddir.  Unfortunately, kdebindings still won't
   build, but it gets a little farther into the build process.
 * kdecvs-pywizard improvements.
 * Add hack to make valgrind build.  Unlike kdebindings, this one actually
   completes now.
 * Show how many modules have been built out of the total number of modules,
   based loosely on a suggestion by David Saxton.

Version history: 0.81
 * Fix use-qt-builddir-hack to work on the second and subsequent runs.
 * Add a warning if you're using qt-copy but qtdir isn't set to use qt-copy

Version history: 0.80
 * Fixed an output quibble discovered by Michal Rokos
 * Added set-env config option.

Version history: 0.77
 * Added inst-apps config option.

Version history: 0.76
 * Added --cvs-only option.
 * Added --build-only option.
 * --help output updates.

Version history: 0.75
 * Add signal handler for SIGPIPE to stop less from aborting the script prematurely.
 * Silence warnings when the script informs you that you're missing the conf file.
 * Try to build modules even if one failed in the update process.
 * Added --rc-file option.
 * Make --debug option use logging in addition to dumping to stdout.

Version history: 0.74
 * Fixed bug processing command line options where --help would call the wrong
   exit routine, leading to some warnings.  I had a fix for this myself, but
   someone sent a (correct) patch, which I couldn't help but to apply.  Thanks
   Kurt!
 * On the same note, the --install option wouldn't work right either because
   we need the conf file to be loaded, but that can't happen until the
   'simple' options like --help, --version, and --author are done.  So now
   options which require an argument set a flag, and the processing is done
   later.
 * Add feature for Amilcar, failed packages will display the path to the
   appropriate log file.
 * Another feature, automatically refresh build system if a Makefile.am is
   added.

Version history: 0.73
 * Added support for timing a build to the program.  Each make attempt is
   timed, along with the install process, and the overall time spent trying to
   install.
 * I can't seem to find a way to separate compilation and linking with
   unsermake, so there will be no such option forthcoming.

Version history: 0.73-pre1
 * Improved autorebuilder process.  Now the module's build directory won't be
   unnecessarily cleaned.
 * Added new configuration file option make-install-prefix.
 * Added exception handling to the main loop.  You should never again have the
   script crash and then have it complain that it's still running.
 * The build process now outputs to a file called build-status in the log
   directory for that run, which reports on the success/failure of each build
   attempt.
 * Fix a bug with use-qt-builddir-hack that caused it to affect all modules
   during the build system setup instead of just qt-copy.
 * Don't add 'global' to the log directory path if we're getting the global
   log directory.
 * Script now informs you of your log directory at the end of the script run.
 * Fix infinite loop when you've disable automatic module install.
 * Added --resume and --resume-from options.

Version history: 0.72
 * qt-copy bugfix #6564: There's no reason to try to download the admin dir
   for qt-copy.
 * The workaround in 0.70 for the autorebuilding bug caused a bug of its own,
   for which I apologize.  Both bugs should now be fixed.
 * kde-common is no longer required to support checkout-only, and will no
   longer be automatically downloaded.  It will still be downloaded if you
   place it in your .kdecvs-buildrc.
 * qt-copy bugfix #2312: Although the last attempt to reconfigure qt-copy was
   inspired, it was ultimately flawed due to programmer incompetence.
 * Rearrange startup sequence a little bit so that you can pass command-line
   options like -v and -h to the program without having to have a configuration
   file.

Version history: 0.71
 * qt-copy bugfix #2342: Force configure to run if qt-copy hasn't been
   configured.
 * Added use-qt-builddir-hack option.
 * Accept GPL license by default for qt-copy.
 * Debug mode improvements.
 * Better script header documentation.
 * Symlink to latest log directory.
 * Check if admin dir has downloaded, and if not, make it do so.

Version history: 0.70
 * Fix the --no-build option.
 * Add the stop-after-failure config file option.
 * The script now comes in its own directory instead of messing up your pwd.
 * Fix handling of the /admin directory on modules where checkout-only is set,
   but had already been checked out.
 * Workaround bug in autorebuilding for qt-copy until I figure out what's
   going on.

Version history: 0.66
 * Make sure UNSERMAKE isn't defined if the module says not to use unsermake.
 * Really fix the bug where "Script starts" output even for dumb things like
   the -v flag.
 * Keep environment changes in the build process for one module from affecting
   other modules.  This should fix a build bug in kdepim due to qt-copy.

Version history: 0.65 2004-Jun-03
 * Fix a horrible horrible bug, where some functions still tried to use the old
   version of log_command(), crashing the script.

Version history: 0.64 2004-Jun-03
 * Basically a code cleanup release, but I did manage to sneak in a few
   bugfixes and features.
 * kdecvs-build will now attempt to rebuild a module from scratch after an
   incremental make failure. You can disable this per-module using the
   no-rebuild-on-fail option.
 * Log directories are now dated, and the log directory can now be changed per
   module.
 * Changed the way that options are read so that command-line options
   completely override settings in the configuration file.
 * You may use false in the configuration file to indicate that you want to
   disable a setting. (Previously you had to either leave the value blank or
   use 0).
 * kdecvs-build now accepts periods (.) in CVS module names.
 * Output is much cleaner thanks to the joys of indentation.
 * Unsermake is only added to the list of packages to download or update if
   you are building a module that relies on it. It used to download if you
   were downloading a module that relied on it.
 * Enabling --debug on the command line will also output what kdecvs-build
   thinks the options are globally and for each module.
 * Documentation improvements.

Version history: 0.63 2004-May-26
 * Another request by Amilcar. :-)  Now all log files end in .log, for
   consistency.

Version history: 0.62 2004-May-25
 * Fix a bug where making sure a module was checked out was trying to ensure
   that the module was built instead.  This meant new users had errors when
   trying to build a module for the first time.  Thanks to Amilcar Lucas for
   spotting the bug.

Version history: 0.61 2004-May-24
 * A few new features, requested by Amilcar Lucas of KDevelop fame.
 * Build directory can now be changed (even per-module!).
 * Log directory can now be changed (It's a global setting though).
 * --recreate-configure command-line option to re-run make -f Makefile.cvs,
   since --build-system-only wasn't quite what I wanted.

Version history: 0.60 2004-May-24
 * Modules are now installed after a successful build.  This means that if you
   are using a single user build of KDE, you can download, build, and install
   everything with a single command.
 * Most commands are logged now.
 * Module passed on the command line are ignored if not present in the
   configuration file.  This prevents problems with typos.
 * Some output cleanups.  For example, the Packages Failed section is only
   printed out if a package has actually failed.
 * CVS over SSH support.  If your CVSROOT begins with :ext:, the environment
   variable CVS_RSH is automatically set to ssh.  Note that the script can't
   access your private key, so you may need to run ssh-agent.
 * Better handling of qt-copy.  Now the script can determine if qt-copy has
   been configured, and won't unnecessarily rebuild from scratch.  The
   apply-patches option should work properly as well.
 * The script returns non-zero on error for use with other scripts.
 * Added options, --debug logs all output to stdout, and --reconfigure allows
   you to reconfigure a module without recreating the build system.
 * Some bug fixes and code cleanups.
 * The --prefix option is always passed to configure instead of letting it
   guess the correct prefix.

Version history: 0.52
 * The PATH environment variable wasn't being set correctly while running the
   configure script.
 * Make sure that KDE and Qt path entries go first in the path in case you 
   already have a KDE installation.

Version history: 0.51
 * Add support for make-options.  This is useful for distcc.
 * Always remove the lockfile on program exit.

Version history: 0.50
 * Add support for qt-copy.  This involved many changes in the script to
   special-case for qt-copy, including not building qt-copy in the build
   directory, configure-flags magic, and a few qt-copy specific options.  For
   example, you can automatically run the apply-patches script in qt-copy.
 * Allow building with unsermake, from kdenonbeta.  If you choose to enable
   unsermake, it is automatically downloaded for you.
 * Added do-not-compile option to block compilation of specific packages.
 * You can now use the tilde (~) when specifying paths, and kdecvs-build will
   replace it with your home directory.
 * Add support for creating .cvsrc.  If you don't have one, the script will
   generate one for you using the recommended options from developer.kde.org/.
 * Now when you use the checkout-only option, you can checkout only a given
   subdirectory of a module.  For example, applets/ksearchapplet from
   kdenonbeta.
 * Some refactoring of code, to join common cases (such as checking-out or
   updating from CVS).
 * Automatically add $KDEDIR/bin and $QTDIR/bin to PATH, and $KDEDIR/lib and
   $QTDIR/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  The script makes sure that colons are only
   present in PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH where necessary.
   (LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib: is bad, for example).
 * Make the --help and --version command line options work even if the program
   is already running.
 * 2004-04-23.

Version history: 0.44
 * Fix CVS checkout bug caused by refactoring.
 * Add logging feature.  Now make output goes to
   $kdecvs/log/$module-$output-file-name if the make-output-file option is
   used.
 * Add --no-cvs command line option to temporarily disable CVS updates.
 * Add --no-build command line option to temporarily disable builds.
 * Add --build-system-only command line options to only create the build
   system, but don't start building.
 * Add --refresh-build command line option to force to build system to be
   rebuilt.

Version history: 0.43
 * Change code layout by refactoring some code into its own function.
   Especially the system calls which must be protected if pretend is set.

Version history: 0.4 
 * Allow comments in .kdecvs-buildrc.
 * Reconfigure to allow more options to be specified by module.  Now CXXFLAGS
   can be set per module, for example.
 * Add new option to output the make process to a file for shorter e-mails.
 * Automatically pulls in kde-common for cases where something is getting
   checked out in pieces.
 * Allows you to set QTDIR, KDEDIR, etc. in order to install the result.
 * Added a few command line options.
 * Added the --pretend command line option which gives a very verbose
   description of what the script is going to do, without doing it.

Version history: 0.3
 * Most features done, needs documentation and bugtesting.
 * 2003-12-29.
