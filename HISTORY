Version history: 0.73
 * Improved autorebuilder process.  Now the module's build directory won't be
   unnecessarily cleaned.

Version history: 0.72
 * qt-copy bugfix #6564: There's no reason to try to download the admin dir
   for qt-copy.
 * The workaround in 0.70 for the autorebuilding bug caused a bug of its own,
   for which I apologize.  Both bugs should now be fixed.
 * kde-common is no longer required to support checkout-only, and will no
   longer be automatically downloaded.  It will still be downloaded if you
   place it in your .kdecvs-buildrc.
 * qt-copy bugfix #2312: Although the last attempt to reconfigure qt-copy was
   inspired, it was ultimately flawed due to programmer incompetence.
 * Rearrange startup sequence a little bit so that you can pass command-line
   options like -v and -h to the program without having to have a configuration
   file.

Version history: 0.71
 * qt-copy bugfix #2342: Force configure to run if qt-copy hasn't been
   configured.
 * Added use-qt-builddir-hack option.
 * Accept GPL license by default for qt-copy.
 * Debug mode improvements.
 * Better script header documentation.
 * Symlink to latest log directory.
 * Check if admin dir has downloaded, and if not, make it do so.

Version history: 0.70
 * Fix the --no-build option.
 * Add the stop-after-failure config file option.
 * The script now comes in its own directory instead of messing up your pwd.
 * Fix handling of the /admin directory on modules where checkout-only is set,
   but had already been checked out.
 * Workaround bug in autorebuilding for qt-copy until I figure out what's
   going on.

Version history: 0.66
 * Make sure UNSERMAKE isn't defined if the module says not to use unsermake.
 * Really fix the bug where "Script starts" output even for dumb things like
   the -v flag.
 * Keep environment changes in the build process for one module from affecting
   other modules.  This should fix a build bug in kdepim due to qt-copy.

Version history: 0.65 2004-Jun-03
 * Fix a horrible horrible bug, where some functions still tried to use the old
   version of log_command(), crashing the script.

Version history: 0.64 2004-Jun-03
 * Basically a code cleanup release, but I did manage to sneak in a few
   bugfixes and features.
 * kdecvs-build will now attempt to rebuild a module from scratch after an
   incremental make failure. You can disable this per-module using the
   no-rebuild-on-fail option.
 * Log directories are now dated, and the log directory can now be changed per
   module.
 * Changed the way that options are read so that command-line options
   completely override settings in the configuration file.
 * You may use false in the configuration file to indicate that you want to
   disable a setting. (Previously you had to either leave the value blank or
   use 0).
 * kdecvs-build now accepts periods (.) in CVS module names.
 * Output is much cleaner thanks to the joys of indentation.
 * Unsermake is only added to the list of packages to download or update if
   you are building a module that relies on it. It used to download if you
   were downloading a module that relied on it.
 * Enabling --debug on the command line will also output what kdecvs-build
   thinks the options are globally and for each module.
 * Documentation improvements.

Version history: 0.63 2004-May-26
 * Another request by Amilcar. :-)  Now all log files end in .log, for
   consistency.

Version history: 0.62 2004-May-25
 * Fix a bug where making sure a module was checked out was trying to ensure
   that the module was built instead.  This meant new users had errors when
   trying to build a module for the first time.  Thanks to Amilcar Lucas for
   spotting the bug.

Version history: 0.61 2004-May-24
 * A few new features, requested by Amilcar Lucas of KDevelop fame.
 * Build directory can now be changed (even per-module!).
 * Log directory can now be changed (It's a global setting though).
 * --recreate-configure command-line option to re-run make -f Makefile.cvs,
   since --build-system-only wasn't quite what I wanted.

Version history: 0.60 2004-May-24
 * Modules are now installed after a successful build.  This means that if you
   are using a single user build of KDE, you can download, build, and install
   everything with a single command.
 * Most commands are logged now.
 * Module passed on the command line are ignored if not present in the
   configuration file.  This prevents problems with typos.
 * Some output cleanups.  For example, the Packages Failed section is only
   printed out if a package has actually failed.
 * CVS over SSH support.  If your CVSROOT begins with :ext:, the environment
   variable CVS_RSH is automatically set to ssh.  Note that the script can't
   access your private key, so you may need to run ssh-agent.
 * Better handling of qt-copy.  Now the script can determine if qt-copy has
   been configured, and won't unnecessarily rebuild from scratch.  The
   apply-patches option should work properly as well.
 * The script returns non-zero on error for use with other scripts.
 * Added options, --debug logs all output to stdout, and --reconfigure allows
   you to reconfigure a module without recreating the build system.
 * Some bug fixes and code cleanups.
 * The --prefix option is always passed to configure instead of letting it
   guess the correct prefix.

Version history: 0.52
 * The PATH environment variable wasn't being set correctly while running the
   configure script.
 * Make sure that KDE and Qt path entries go first in the path in case you 
   already have a KDE installation.

Version history: 0.51
 * Add support for make-options.  This is useful for distcc.
 * Always remove the lockfile on program exit.

Version history: 0.50
 * Add support for qt-copy.  This involved many changes in the script to
   special-case for qt-copy, including not building qt-copy in the build
   directory, configure-flags magic, and a few qt-copy specific options.  For
   example, you can automatically run the apply-patches script in qt-copy.
 * Allow building with unsermake, from kdenonbeta.  If you choose to enable
   unsermake, it is automatically downloaded for you.
 * Added do-not-compile option to block compilation of specific packages.
 * You can now use the tilde (~) when specifying paths, and kdecvs-build will
   replace it with your home directory.
 * Add support for creating .cvsrc.  If you don't have one, the script will
   generate one for you using the recommended options from developer.kde.org/.
 * Now when you use the checkout-only option, you can checkout only a given
   subdirectory of a module.  For example, applets/ksearchapplet from
   kdenonbeta.
 * Some refactoring of code, to join common cases (such as checking-out or
   updating from CVS).
 * Automatically add $KDEDIR/bin and $QTDIR/bin to PATH, and $KDEDIR/lib and
   $QTDIR/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  The script makes sure that colons are only
   present in PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH where necessary.
   (LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib: is bad, for example).
 * Make the --help and --version command line options work even if the program
   is already running.
 * 2004-04-23.

Version history: 0.44
 * Fix CVS checkout bug caused by refactoring.
 * Add logging feature.  Now make output goes to
   $kdecvs/log/$module-$output-file-name if the make-output-file option is
   used.
 * Add --no-cvs command line option to temporarily disable CVS updates.
 * Add --no-build command line option to temporarily disable builds.
 * Add --build-system-only command line options to only create the build
   system, but don't start building.
 * Add --refresh-build command line option to force to build system to be
   rebuilt.

Version history: 0.43
 * Change code layout by refactoring some code into its own function.
   Especially the system calls which must be protected if pretend is set.

Version history: 0.4 
 * Allow comments in .kdecvs-buildrc.
 * Reconfigure to allow more options to be specified by module.  Now CXXFLAGS
   can be set per module, for example.
 * Add new option to output the make process to a file for shorter e-mails.
 * Automatically pulls in kde-common for cases where something is getting
   checked out in pieces.
 * Allows you to set QTDIR, KDEDIR, etc. in order to install the result.
 * Added a few command line options.
 * Added the --pretend command line option which gives a very verbose
   description of what the script is going to do, without doing it.

Version history: 0.3
 * Most features done, needs documentation and bugtesting.
 * 2003-12-29.
