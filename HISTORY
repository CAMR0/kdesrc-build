 * Fix a bug where making sure a module was checked out was trying to ensure
   that the module was built instead.  This meant new users had errors when
   trying to build a module for the first time.  Thanks to Amilcar Lucas for
   spotting the bug.

Version history: 0.61 2004-May-24
 * A few new features, requested by Amilcar Lucas of KDevelop fame.
 * Build directory can now be changed (even per-module!).
 * Log directory can now be changed (It's a global setting though).
 * --recreate-configure command-line option to re-run make -f Makefile.cvs,
   since --build-system-only wasn't quite what I wanted.

Version history: 0.60 2004-May-24
 * Modules are now installed after a successful build.  This means that if you
   are using a single user build of KDE, you can download, build, and install
   everything with a single command.
 * Most commands are logged now.
 * Module passed on the command line are ignored if not present in the
   configuration file.  This prevents problems with typos.
 * Some output cleanups.  For example, the Packages Failed section is only
   printed out if a package has actually failed.
 * CVS over SSH support.  If your CVSROOT begins with :ext:, the environment
   variable CVS_RSH is automatically set to ssh.  Note that the script can't
   access your private key, so you may need to run ssh-agent.
 * Better handling of qt-copy.  Now the script can determine if qt-copy has
   been configured, and won't unnecessarily rebuild from scratch.  The
   apply-patches option should work properly as well.
 * The script returns non-zero on error for use with other scripts.
 * Added options, --debug logs all output to stdout, and --reconfigure allows
   you to reconfigure a module without recreating the build system.
 * Some bug fixes and code cleanups.
 * The --prefix option is always passed to configure instead of letting it
   guess the correct prefix.

Version history: 0.52
 * The PATH environment variable wasn't being set correctly while running the
   configure script.
 * Make sure that KDE and Qt path entries go first in the path in case you 
   already have a KDE installation.

Version history: 0.51
 * Add support for make-options.  This is useful for distcc.
 * Always remove the lockfile on program exit.

Version history: 0.50
 * Add support for qt-copy.  This involved many changes in the script to
   special-case for qt-copy, including not building qt-copy in the build
   directory, configure-flags magic, and a few qt-copy specific options.  For
   example, you can automatically run the apply-patches script in qt-copy.
 * Allow building with unsermake, from kdenonbeta.  If you choose to enable
   unsermake, it is automatically downloaded for you.
 * Added do-not-compile option to block compilation of specific packages.
 * You can now use the tilde (~) when specifying paths, and kdecvs-build will
   replace it with your home directory.
 * Add support for creating .cvsrc.  If you don't have one, the script will
   generate one for you using the recommended options from developer.kde.org/.
 * Now when you use the checkout-only option, you can checkout only a given
   subdirectory of a module.  For example, applets/ksearchapplet from
   kdenonbeta.
 * Some refactoring of code, to join common cases (such as checking-out or
   updating from CVS).
 * Automatically add $KDEDIR/bin and $QTDIR/bin to PATH, and $KDEDIR/lib and
   $QTDIR/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  The script makes sure that colons are only
   present in PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH where necessary.
   (LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib: is bad, for example).
 * Make the --help and --version command line options work even if the program
   is already running.
 * 2004-04-23.

Version history: 0.44
 * Fix CVS checkout bug caused by refactoring.
 * Add logging feature.  Now make output goes to
   $kdecvs/log/$module-$output-file-name if the make-output-file option is
   used.
 * Add --no-cvs command line option to temporarily disable CVS updates.
 * Add --no-build command line option to temporarily disable builds.
 * Add --build-system-only command line options to only create the build
   system, but don't start building.
 * Add --refresh-build command line option to force to build system to be
   rebuilt.

Version history: 0.43
 * Change code layout by refactoring some code into its own function.
   Especially the system calls which must be protected if pretend is set.

Version history: 0.4 
 * Allow comments in .kdecvs-buildrc.
 * Reconfigure to allow more options to be specified by module.  Now CXXFLAGS
   can be set per module, for example.
 * Add new option to output the make process to a file for shorter e-mails.
 * Automatically pulls in kde-common for cases where something is getting
   checked out in pieces.
 * Allows you to set QTDIR, KDEDIR, etc. in order to install the result.
 * Added a few command line options.
 * Added the --pretend command line option which gives a very verbose
   description of what the script is going to do, without doing it.

Version history: 0.3
 * Most features done, needs documentation and bugtesting.
 * 2003-12-29.
