 * Add support for qt-copy.  This involved many changes in the script to
   special-case for qt-copy, including not building qt-copy in the build
   directory, configure-flags magic, and a few qt-copy specific options.  For
   example, you can automatically run the apply-patches script in qt-copy.
 * Allow building with unsermake, from kdenonbeta.  If you choose to enable
   unsermake, it is automatically downloaded for you.
 * Added do-not-compile option to block compilation of specific packages.
 * You can now use the tilde (~) when specifying paths, and kdecvs-build will
   replace it with your home directory.
 * Add support for creating .cvsrc.  If you don't have one, the script will
   generate one for you using the recommended options from developer.kde.org/.
 * Now when you use the checkout-only option, you can checkout only a given
   subdirectory of a module.  For example, applets/ksearchapplet from
   kdenonbeta.
 * Some refactoring of code, to join common cases (such as checking-out or
   updating from CVS).
 * Automatically add $KDEDIR/bin and $QTDIR/bin to PATH, and $KDEDIR/lib and
   $QTDIR/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  The script makes sure that colons are only
   present in PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH where necessary.
   (LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib: is bad, for example).
 * Make the --help and --version command line options work even if the program
   is already running.

 * Fix CVS checkout bug caused by refactoring.
 * Add logging feature.  Now make output goes to
   $kdecvs/log/$module-$output-file-name if the make-output-file option is
   used.
 * Add --no-cvs command line option to temporarily disable CVS updates.
 * Add --no-build command line option to temporarily disable builds.
 * Add --build-system-only command line options to only create the build
   system, but don't start building.
 * Add --refresh-build command line option to force to build system to be
   rebuilt.

Version history: 0.43
 * Change code layout by refactoring some code into its own function.
   Especially the system calls which must be protected if pretend is set.

Version history: 0.4 
 * Allow comments in .kdecvs-buildrc.
 * Reconfigure to allow more options to be specified by module.  Now CXXFLAGS
   can be set per module, for example.
 * Add new option to output the make process to a file for shorter e-mails.
 * Automatically pulls in kde-common for cases where something is getting
   checked out in pieces.
 * Allows you to set QTDIR, KDEDIR, etc. in order to install the result.
 * Added a few command line options.
 * Added the --pretend command line option which gives a very verbose
   description of what the script is going to do, without doing it.

Version history: 0.3
 * Most features done, needs documentation and bugtesting.
