<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>kdecvs-build is a Perl script to help users install <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> from 
<A href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</A>.  Unlike the two scripts available at 
<a href="http://developer.kde.org/build/compile_cvs.html">http://developer.kde.org/build/compile_cvs.html</a>,
this script neither requires nor uses <a href="http://www.cvsup.org/">CVSup</a>, for
those who either can't or don't feel like installing it.</p>

<p>It is authored by Michael Pyne (mpyne (AT) grammarian (DOT) homelinux 
(DOT) net), and is one of several build scripts for this purpose.</p>

<p><b>2004-Jun-14:</b> v0.73<br />
Bugfixes:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="#conf-no-rebuild-on-fail">no-rebuild-on-fail</a>
configuration file option didn't actually work in prior versions.</li>
<li>The log file for a build now has a number appended, since multiple build
attempts can occur during a single script run.</li>
</ul>

Features:
<ul>
<li>Based on a suggestion by mornfall, the autorebuilding process doesn't
clean out the build directory for a module when trying to rebuild.  In
addition, on a failure, make will be run again since sometimes that's all it
takes to make it work.  If the build process still fails, the build system
will be recreated, but the build directory won't be cleaned.  This is a big
time saver, and should give the same results.  Using the <a
href="#cmdline-refresh-build">--refresh-build</a> option will still cause the
build directory to be cleaned at this point.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>2004-Jun-13:</b> v0.72 -- <em>This Should Work Edition&trade;</em><br/>
Bugfixes:
<ul>
<li>qt-copy bugfix #6564: There's no reason to try to download the admir dir
for qt-copy, so let's not bother trying.</li>

<li>The workaround in 0.70 and 0.71 for the autorebuilding bug caused a bug of
its own (no, I don't work for Microsoft), for which I apologize.  Both bugs
should now be fixed.</li>

<li>kde-common is no longer required to support <a
href="#conf-checkout-only">checkout-only</a>, and will therefore no longer be
automatically downloaded.  It will still be downloaded if you place it in your
.kdecvs-buildrc.</li>

<li>qt-copy bugfix #2312: Although the last attempt to reconfigure qt-copy
only when needed was inspired, it was ultimately flawed due to programmer
incompetence. ;-)</li>

<li>Rearrange command-line options a little bit so that you can pass the <a
href="#cmdline-help">--help</a> and <a href="#cmdline-version">--version</a>
options to the script without having to have a configuration file installed.
</li>

<li>Although not related to the end-user experience of the script per se, my
packing script for kdecvs-build has been updated in the downtime while testing
the script, and now keeps me from doing stupid stuff like forgetting to
upgrade the version number in the script, forgetting to commit my changes to
my CVS repository, and forgetting to actually install the script to test.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>2004-Jun-12:</b> v0.71<br/>
This release is dedicated to the heavy testing given the script by berkus and
mornfall.  Thanks guys!
</p>

Bugfixes:
<ul>
<li>Make script header documentation better.</li>
<li>Force configure to run if qt-copy hasn't been configured.  If you had
interrupted the build process for qt-copy before the configure script had run,
it wouldn't build right after that.</li>
</ul>

New features:
<ul>
<li>If the admin directory does not exist for some reason, kick CVS in the
head repeatedly until it checks it out. (I'm not responsible if CVS ends up in
a coma).</li>

<li>Accept GPL license by default for qt-copy.  If you happen to have a
commerical license or some such for qt-copy, patches are accepted. :-)</li>

<li>Debug mode additions.</li>

<li>Experimental mode to simulate builddir != srcdir mode for qt-copy, as
requested by berkus.  This needs more testing, but it seems to Work For
Me&trade;.  The appropriate configuration file option is <a
href="#conf-use-qt-builddir-hack">use-qt-builddir-hack</a>.</li>

<li>The script now creates a symlink to the latest log directory called
<tt>latest</tt>.  So you can always review the log of the last day the script
ran in by browsing $(cvs-root)/log/latest.</li>

</ul>

<p>I recommend that you set up a separate user account if you decide to run KDE
from CVS.  I didn't at first, and I won't repeat that mistake for KDE 3.3 ;-).
I would also recommend that you add this script to your crontab so that you
don't have to worry about manually running the build process.  The script
employs locking to prevent parallel execution.  You also need to follow the
instructions on <a
href="http://developer.kde.org/source/anoncvs.html">http://developer.kde.org/source/anoncvs.html</a>
to set up your .cvsrc and .cvspass.  You should also follow the instructions on
that page regarding setting up your own repository, especially if you intend to
use qt-copy.  Make sure that qt-copy, arts, kdelibs, and kdebase are listed in
that order in your configuration file.  If you perform a single-user install of
kdecvs-build, all you have to do to download, build, and install KDE from CVS
(assuming no build errors) is to run the script.
<pre>$ kdecvs-build
</pre>
</p>

<p>If you perform a system-wide installation, you can run the entire script
as root, although I would recommend using your distribution's packages or
<a href="http://developer.kde.org/build/konstruct/">Konstruct</a> to install a
stable KDE.</p>

<hr>
<a name="features"></a>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Features that I can think of off the top of my head:
<ul>

<li>Automatically checks out modules from CVS or updates from CVS, as
appropriate.</li>

<li>Support for checking out specific branches of CVS modules.

<li>Much better support for qt-copy than 0.4x.</li>

<li>Can create a .cvsrc automatically if you forget to. .cvspass still isn't
automatically created.</li>

<li><A href="http://www.kde.me.uk/index.php?page=unsermake">Unsermake</A>
support.</li>

<li>Tilde-expansion for your configuration options.  For example, you can
specify: <pre>qtdir ~/kdecvs/qt-copy</pre></li>

<li>Configurable build and logging directories</li>

<li>Automatically sets up a build system, with the source directory not the
same as the build directory, in order to keep the CVS download directory
pristine. The exception is qt-copy, which isn't designed to be built like
that.</li>

<li>You can specify global options to apply to every module to check out, and
you can specify options to apply to individual modules as well.</li>

<li>Since the autotools sometimes get out of sync with changes to the CVS
source tree, you can force a rebuild of a module by creating a file called
.refresh-me in the build directory of the module in question, or by running
kdecvs-build with the --refresh-build option.</li>

<li>You can specify various environment values to be used during the build,
including KDEDIR, QTDIR, DO_NOT_COMPILE, and CXXFLAGS.</li>

<li>Includes CVS over SSH support.  The script CANNOT access your private key
if it is password protected, so using ssh-agent is recommended.</li>

<li>Command logging.  Logs are not dated, so they are overwritten after
consecutive runs of the program.</li>

<li>If you're using a user build of KDE instead of a system build (for which
you must be root to install), you can use the script to install for you.  I
haven't audited this code, and it makes ample use of the <code>system()</code>
call, so I would not recommend running it as root at this point.</li>

<li>You can check out only a portion of a KDE CVS module.  For example, you
could check out only taglib from kdesupport, or only K3B from kdeextragear-1.
The script will automatically pull in kde-common if necessary to make the build
work.</li>

<li>You can "pretend" to do the operations.  If you pass --pretend or -p on the
command line, the script will give a very verbose description of the commands
it is about to execute, without actually executing it.</li>

<li>Saves a list of the modules that successfully built as the file
successfully-built in the build directory.</li>

<li>Can log output of the make command to a file in $KDECVSDIR/log.</li>

</ul></p>
<p>Things that kdecvs-build does NOT do:
<ul>
<li>Find the fastest KDE CVS mirror.  There isn't even a list shipped
with the script at this point.</li>
<li>Brush your teeth.  You should remember to do that yourself.</li>
<li>The script probably isn't bug-free.  Sorry.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<hr>
<a name=".kdecvs-buildrc"></a>
<h3>Format of .kdecvs-buildrc</h3>
<p>To use the script, you must have a file in your home directory called
.kdecvs-buildrc, which describes the modules you'd like to download and
build.</p>
<p>It starts with the global options, specified like the following:</p>
<code>global<br/>
<i>option-name option-value</i><br/>
<i>[...]</i><br/>
end global
</code>
<p>It is then followed by one or more module sections, specified like the
following:</p>
<code>module <i>module-name</i><br/>
<i>option-name option-value</i><br/>
<i>[...]</i><br/>
end module
</code>
<p><i>module-name</i> must be a module from the KDE CVS repository (for
example, kdelibs or kdebase).  Some options override global options, some
add to global options, and some global options simply can't be overridden.
</p>
<hr>
<a name="options"></a>
<h3>Configuration file Options</h3>

<p>Here is a table of the various options, and some comments on them.  Any
option which overrides the global option will override a command line setting
as well.</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr align="center" style="font-style: italic;">
<td valign="top">Option-name</td>
<td valign="top">Module -&gt; Global Behavior</td>
<td>Notes</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-apply-qt-patches">
<td valign="top">apply-qt-patches</td>
<td valign="top">Overrides global</td>
<td>This option is only useful for qt-copy.  If it is set to a non-zero value,
then the apply-patches script in qt-copy will be run prior to building, in
order to apply the non-official patches to the qt-copy.  Since these patches
are normally the reason for using qt-copy instead of a stock Qt, it shouldn't
do any harm to enable it.</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-binpath">
<td valign="top">binpath</td>
<td valign="top">Can't be overridden</td>
<td><p>Set this option to set the environment variable PATH while building.
You can't override this setting in a module option.  The default value is
empty, which is likely not what you want.  This environment variable should
include the colon-separated paths of your development toolchain.  The paths
$KDEDIR/bin and $QTDIR/bin are automatically added.  You may use the tilde (~)
for any paths you add using this option.</p>

<p>On my system, the setting
<pre>    binpath /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin</pre>
is the minimally sufficient setting.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr id="conf-build-dir">
<td valign="top">build-dir</td>
<td valign="top">Overrides global</td>
<td>Use this option to change the directory to contain the built sources. There
are three different ways to use it:
<ul>

<li><p>Relative to the KDE CVS source directory ($KDECVS).  This is the
default, and the way the script worked up to version v0.61.  This mode is
selected if you type a directory name that doesn't start with a tilde (~) or a
slash (/).</p> <p>The default value is <b>build</b>.</p></li>

<li>Absolute path.  If you specify a path that begins with a /, then that path
is used directory.  For example, <i>/tmp/kde-obj-dir/</i>.</li>

<li>Relative to your home directory.  If you specify a path that begins with a
~, then the path is used relative to your home directory, analogous to the
shell's tilde-expansion.  For example, <i>~/builddir</i> would set the build
directory to <i>/home/mpyne/builddir</i> on my system.</li>

</ul>

Perhaps surprisingly, this option can be changed per module.

<td>Set this option to only create the build system for this module.  What that

the configure script will be created (but not run), and make will not be run.
This option is exactly equivalent to the <a

This command is useful for checking what configure-flags each module supports

piece by piece, the admin directory will be pulled in from kde-common, which

never try to do this to a module that already was tried to be built from
scratch.

<li id="cmdline-refresh-build">--refresh-build, Recreate the build system and
make from scratch.</li>

<li id="cmdline-reconfigure">--reconfigure, Run the configure script again
without cleaning the build directory.</li>

<li id="cmdline-recreate-configure">--recreate-configure, Run <code>make -f
Makefile.cvs</code> again to create the configure script, and continue
building as normal.  This option implies --reconfigure.</li>

<li id="cmdline-build-system-only">--build-system-only, Stop after runnning
make -f Makefile.cvs.  The configure script will still need to be run, which
kdecvs-build will do next time.  This lets you prepare all the configure
scripts at once so you can view the ./configure --help for each module, and
edit your configure-flags accordingly.</li>

<li id="cmdline-install">--install, If this is the only command-line option,
it tries to install all of the modules contained in successfully-built, except
for qt-copy, which doesn't need installation.  If command-line options are
specified after --install, they are all assumed to be modules to install.
Note that after v0.60, modules are automatically installed if they build
successfully.</li>

Any other command-line options are assumed to be modules to update and build.
Don't mix building with installing.</li>
</ul>
