# This file maps KDE git repository names to the appropriate **direct**
# dependencies for the various popular distributions.
#
# Assistance from the wider community is appreciated in keeping this up to
# date! CHECK YOUR EDITOR SETTINGS CAREFULLY. We are ALL SPACES here.
#
# Structure: Each repository's name (not the whole path, *just* the name) is
# mapped to a dictionary that itself maps each supported vendor's ID/VERSION_ID
# combination (as from /etc/os-release) to a list of package names for that
# vendor's OS.
#
# Exactly 1 or 0 ID/VERSION_ID combinations is chosen. A generic vendor ID
# (as set by ID_LIKE in /etc/os-release) will be used if a more specific vendor ID
# is not listed here. but if a more specific vendor ID *is* listed then it should
# be comprehensive (no "inheritance" is done from a generic ID).
#
# The vendor is determined before the version is looked up (so
# don't add entries for a derivative distribution if the
# versions will be outdated). Rolling release distros don't have a version,
# kdesrc-build will assign a version of "unknown" here.
#
# Packages that are effectively required for everything should be listed as
# dependencies of extra-cmake-modules for now until I decide on something
# better.
#
# Remember to add -dev / -devel versions as appropriate!
