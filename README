kdesrc-build 1.14.1

*** QUICK HOWTO ***

1.  Copy kdesrc-build somewhere where you will be able to find it.

2.
    a) If you don't already have a ~/.kdesrc-buildrc, use the kdesrc-build-setup
program to make one, or copy kdesrc-buildrc-sample to ~/.kdesrc-buildrc and
make any changes that you need.

    b) If you do have a ~/.kdesrc-buildrc, I recommend looking through the
kdesrc-buildrc-sample to ensure that your configuration doesn't need changed
(due to feature additions or changes to the KDE source repositories).

    c) NOTE: There is no kde-qt module anymore. There *is* a Qt mirror hosted
on the kde infrastructure, which you can access using "repository kde:qt" in
your qt module.

3.  Run "/path/to/kdesrc-build --pretend".  This will have kdesrc-build go
through the steps that it would perform, but without actually doing them.
This is a good time to make sure that kdesrc-build is set the way you want it.

4.  When you're ready, run "/path/to/kdesrc-build".  Hopefully everything will
go well the first time, and kdesrc-build will be able to download and build
all of the modules that you ask for. :)

*** UPGRADING KDESRC-BUILD ***

Upgrading is simple.  Just copy the new kdesrc-build over the old one, and
then you may want to edit your ~/.kdesrc-buildrc to make sure any new options
are included (if you'd like).  You should always read the changes for the new
version however, as sometimes there are slight changes in behavior necessary
to adapt to updates in the source repository.

You can use the 'kdesrc-build --version' command to ensure that you have
successfully upgraded kdesrc-build.

*** SAMPLE CONFIGURATION ***

A sample configuration file is included.  It should work for you for the most
part with only minor tweaking.  To use it, just copy it to ~/.kdesrc-buildrc.

Alternatively, a program is included starting with kdesrc-build 1.14 called
kdesrc-build-setup which can be used to generate a simple configuration.

*** HELP!!! ***

kdesrc-build includes a limited command-line description with the
--help option.

You can read the kdesrc-build handbook online at
http://kdesrc-build.kde.org/documentation/.

You can ask for help online on the #kde-devel channel of IRC (irc.kde.org).

You can also ask on the KDE support mailing lists, such as kde-devel@kde.org

Finally you can drop me an email at mpyne@kde.org (although I have a job/family
and therefore don't always have time to respond)

*** UPDATES / CONTACT INFO ***

You can find updated versions of kdesrc-build online as part of the
extragear/utils module: (You can also see the change log this way)

https://projects.kde.org/projects/extragear/utils/kdesrc-build

(Note: Many kde modules are migrating to git.kde.org. This may require frequent updates
to kdesrc-buildrc until the next release of kdesrc-build, which will support auto-updating
many of these modules from the KDE Projects page)

If you find a bug, please report it at:

If you have any questions, feel free to let me know:
  Michael Pyne <mpyne@kde.org>

If I don't respond in a couple of days I'm probably really busy, in which
case I apologize and you should contact the kde-devel@kde.org mailing list.
